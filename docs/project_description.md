# TRAINING PROJECT

## KBase - Knowledge Base

### 🎯 What We're Building

A project knowledge base system where teams can store and manage project information. Team members can upload project documents (guides, specs, meeting notes), videos (recordings, tutorials), and other files.

Optionally, add an AI chatbot to help quickly find information by answering questions about stored content.

**What You'll Learn:**
- **Backend**: Build REST APIs with Java Spring Boot (authentication, file upload, API docs with Swagger)
- **Frontend**: Create web pages with React or Next.js (upload files, dashboards, search)
- **Storage**: Use PostgreSQL for data, MinIO or S3 for files
- **Deployment**: Deploy with Docker, AWS, or other platforms
- **Optional Features**: AI chatbot (Python), Terraform/Terragrunt, Kubernetes
